# MMGF-Net
MMGF-Net:Multi-Modal Graph Fusion Network for Pregnancy Prediction  

The "MMGF-Net" folder is our proposed method.  
The "ODIR.zip" and the "feature.xlsx" are a multimodal dataset that we have proposed through improvement.

The "make_temp.py" is used to create temporary files (temp folder) to store image locations, keyword features, and labels.
